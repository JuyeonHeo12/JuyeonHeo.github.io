### Dear Microsoft AI Residency Program, 

I am writing to apply for the position of Microsoft AI Residency Program. Now I am dual-majoring in business administration and software and working at the lab under Professor Taesup Moon of information engineering, SKKU. I am planning to graduate in July, 2018. I am confident that my research interests, core values and ability make me an ideal candidate for open position. 

### 1. I wish to join the Microsoft AI Residency Program to realize my core value.

 My core value is **_“Change daily lives with new technologies”_** and I think  Microsoft AI Residency Program is the best place to realize my value.
I want to change the way people live. It makes me thrilled to see the changes of how people do and feel when using what I made. That’s why I decided to specialize in business at university. In the idea contest on Fin-tech held by Hyundai-card, I designed the business model that users can use the interest on cards in mobile gift market and game to make them enjoy its high interest rate. When it applied in the real business model and I was vibrated with joy to see how it changed users’ behavior and read the reviews and feedbacks from the users. However, I found this would be better when combined with technologies while I was suggesting the business ideas on products or services. It would be better to understand each customer’s need based on accumulated information to provide customized services. Thus, I selected dual major in computer science to develop the front line of technology which can impact lives of each people. On research, I wrote the paper suggesting new methods about sentiment analysis in Korean with machine learning which would find the needs of customer from online reviews. During the writing an article, I found researching on machine learning was interesting because I could feel its rapid growth like a child’s. It was attractive to join in developing the front line technologies which impacts daily lives a lot. That’s why I wanted to study on AI more deeply, and I got into the research lab specific to deep learning. Now, I am studying models for making accurate diagnosis of the degree of pain with fMRI using CNN model. I am focusing on making them interpretable to understand which brain parts impacts the differences of results.
I thought  Microsoft AI Residency Program is the best place to study the front line of deep learning. In addition, I believe that the program will influence lots of people with scalable applications based on plentiful resources. By sharing noble ideas on technologies and developing them with people from various fields, the program would be helpful for me to decide my future plan on research and to have appropriate attitude as a researcher. I expect the greater synergy effect would be created because  Microsoft AI Residency Program and I pursue the similar goal: Give people better way to live with new technologies.
 

### 2. I have the ability to research AI and contribute to  Microsoft AI Residency Program

#### (1)	Experience on research about machine learning and deep learning

I wrote the paper as the lead author on NLP for Decision Support System which is the top tier journal on information system. During the research, I wanted to know the needs of customer from their online reviews because I have already experienced the limits of few sample of survey and interview. However, there are few research on sentiment analysis reflecting unique features of Korean language. Thus, I wrote the thesis about NLP suggesting new methods to get a better result from sentiment analysis of Korean reviews. Since my professor in business just has started research on NLP, machine learning, I got the opportunity to complete the paper all by myself. I designed the whole process of defining problem, designing research, making code and conducting the experiment. It was a good chance to experience the full cycle of research and to learn how to deal with the failures. While conducting the research, I wanted to study deep learning more deeply to apply to  more various fields. Thus, I took the online lectures and did assignments about machine learning, University of Washinton, Coursera, and computer vision with deep learning, Stanford CS231n. After that, I worked at the lab which conducts research on deep learning. As a member of the lab, I am studying to make accurate model diagnosing the degree of pain with deep learning methods by collaborating with brain neuro science team.

#### (2)	Cooperating with teams

I experienced about 90 team projects in total and 10 projects average in each semester from business classes and competitions. Every team projects made me to face different types of troubles with members, unexpected situations and conflicts when building ideas. Through all these difficulties, I could develop my own know-how: having sense of ownership and respecting team members as professional advisors. It makes me respect all members’ idea and even though I did more than the others, because I know doing together is better than doing it alone. Changing a point of view was also helpful to work with people from other countries. I worked with 5 exchange students from China, India, France, and USA to make health app prototype for panic disorder patients. Even though we went through problems because of different communication style, we tried to understand each other’s characteristic and got the best score on team projects. Still I have a long way to go, but I’m sure I can deal with and find the way to solve the conflicts that I will face. Also, now I am conducting research on diagnosis of pain with brain expert professors. We provide knowledge on data science to neuro science team and they give knowledge on brain to us. It is exciting to work with other field of science and I am looking forward to experiencing other collaboration with different field of science.

#### (3)	Apply AI to real world case

As the team leader, I led our team to win the first prize at the consulting competition held by the rental-car company. I was a leader of the team with 4 members and suggested new business model applied with machine learning. We suggested the model to predict the pattern of using car from different companies which are customers of rental car by using K-means clustering and random forest. The proposal was evaluated not only cost effective but also creative in terms of using data to increase predictability. It was a great experience to combine AI with business, and I want to have more chance to apply AI in real world case. 

### 3. Long term plans
After watching the NIPS 2017 videos, I thought I can study on two stream in machine learning. Proving the process of AI with mathematical background, and developing noble models inspired by human brain mechanism. As doctor doing the checkups before treatment, I think we should know and understand how AI works in detail. To do so, I am focusing on ‘interpretable AI’ now. I am exploring the big stream of research in machine learning by reading articles, designing the model and applying them to real case – diagnosing the pain with brain fMRI based on such as LRP, decomposition.
