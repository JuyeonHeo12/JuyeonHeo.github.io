_Why you think you'd be great for the Google AI Residency Program?_

**1.	My core values fit with Google’s philosophy.**
 My core values to pursue is **_“Impact people’s life with technologies”_** which fits to Google’s philosophy.
 I like to impact people’s daily lives. It makes me thrilled to see the changes of how people do and feel by what I made. That’s why I decided to specialize business at university. In the idea competition of Fin-tech for Hyundai-card company, I designed business model that users can use interest of cards on mobile gift market and game to make them enjoy its high interest rate. It was added in the real business model and I was vibrated with joy when I see how it changed users’ behavior and read the reviews and feedbacks. However, as I found how technology changes people’s lives dramatically, I can’t stop falling in attractions of technology. It makes me happy to study the new technologies in the science magazine, imagine how it changes the world and discuss with friends in various major. Thus, I started to double major computer science to develop the front line of technology by myself and impact people’s daily lives. On research, I wrote paper suggesting new methods about sentiment analysis in Korean with machine learning to find the needs of customer with online reviews. Also, I am studying models for making accurate diagnosis of the degree of pain with fMRI by deep learning methods. I am hunger for research on fundamental algorithms and application about machine learning and deep learning. I thought Google is the best place to study the front line of deep learning and impact lots of people with scalable applications. Communicating with people in various fields who will be in Google AI residency program about new methods and imagine its future will inspired me to have vision on long-term research. I expect the synergy effect will be significant because Google and I have same direction to pursue: Change people’s lives with new technologies. 

**2.	I have ability to research AI and contribute to Google AI residency program**

(1)	Experience on research about machine learning and deep learning
I wrote the paper as the lead author on NLP for Decision Support System which is top tier journal on information system. As my first research, I wanted to know the needs of customer with online reviews because I experienced limits of survey and interview with only a few samples. However, there are few research on considering unique features of Korean language. Thus, I wrote a thesis about NLP suggesting new methods to get a better result in sentiment analysis in Korean reviews. Because my MIS professor didn’t have knowledge on computer science, I did the full process of writing paper by myself: defining problem, designing research, making code and conducting the experiment. It was good opportunity to experience the full cycle of research and practice dealing with failures. While conducting the research, I wanted to study deep learning for research on much more various fields. Thus, I took Stanford’s CS231n online lectures and tried to come up with novel way on assignments. After that, I got into the lab of deep learning and I am studying making accurate diagnosis of pain with fMRI by deep learning methods.

(2)	Collaboration with teams
I experienced more than 120 team projects in business classes and competitions. Every team projects gave me different types of troubles with members, unexpected situations and conflicts on building ideas. After undergoing all these difficulties, I can develop my own know-how gradually to communicate, deal with problems and build ideas with various types of members. Because it’s not perfect, I still go through hard situations but I know I can deal with them and find way to solve them. Also, now I am conducting research on diagnosis of pain with brain expert professors. We provide knowledge of data science and they give knowledge on brain. It is exciting to work with other field of science and I am looking for much more opportunity to study with various fields. 

(3)	Apply AI to real world case
I won first prize on competition of consulting rental car company in industry university project. I was a leader of the team with 4 members and suggested new business model applied with machine learning. We suggested model to predict the car use pattern of each companies which are customers of rental car with K-means clustering and random forest. It was evaluated as cost effective proposal with novel approach of using data to increase realistic possibility. It was great experience to connect business and AI, and I want to have more opportunity to learn.
