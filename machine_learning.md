**Abstract**

* Feature selection plays an important role in sentimental analysis to perform well. In this paper, a supervised feature selection approach is presented, which is considering not only feature-feature and feature-target variable relationship but also trying to include only mutually exclusive and completely exhaustive features for efficiency. Applying a clustering, the two methods searches for a best set of features based on hybrid approach which is combination between filter and wrapper methods. Eventually, several experiments using 4 Korean datasets are presented to show the effectiveness of the features selected with two methods from the point of view of the number of features needed to reach certain classification accuracy.
