### _"Developing nuroimaging biomarkers for pain and emotions using interpretable deep learning"_

 *  Collaborating with brain research team to make accurate diagnosis model of pain with fMRI based on neural network. Preprocessing the data with normalization considering the characteristics of data and conducting experiments to making models with high performance.
 
 * We provide knowledge of data science and they give knowledge on brain. It is exciting to work with other field of science and I am looking for much more opportunity to study with various fields.
